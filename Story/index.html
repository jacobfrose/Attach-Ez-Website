            The phrase &quot;necessity is the mother of invention&quot; couldn't be a more accurate statement in describing the emergence of the <b>ATTACH-EZ Object Mounting Systems for Custom Picture Framing</b>. 
            Anyone who owns a frame shop can identify with the problems that arise when you lose the use of one of your hands, which is what happened to me.
            <p>Right before Christmas, and with many mounting jobs still not complete, I dislocated my left thumb and ended up in a cast for six weeks. 
            At the time I had two football jerseys, some doilies, and the <a class="vlightbox1" href="images/1000031w.jpg" target="_blank">baptismal gown</a> (pictured on the &quot;<a href="../How It Works/index.html">How It Works</a>&quot; page) scheduled for framing.</p>
            <p>Being a one person frame shop, and even though my husband is very supportive (he does all the cooking), he has the patience of a gnat when it comes to doing anything tedious like the sewing involved in mounting doilies and T-shirts. 
            Needless to say I was a desperate woman who really didn't want to disappoint the customers. That's when I discovered how resourceful I can be when faced with a disaster in the making. 
            I started looking through my sewing box for something that would help me with all these special projects and found an old tool that I used when I was a manufacturer's rep years ago. 
            To my relief, it worked amazingly well for making the holes needed , figuring I could sew with one hand.  That&rsquo;s when it occurred to me that maybe I could get some tools and fasteners that were smaller and more adaptable to fabric mounting.</p>
            <p>
            <a class="vlightbox1" href="images/1000031w.jpg" title=""><img src="images/1000031th.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="185" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3"/></a>
            
            I discussed my idea with my local distributor's salesperson and he thought it was one of the best ideas he had seen in a long time. 
            With the strong encouragement of this salesperson and my local distributor I jumped in head first, thus the beginning of <b>ATTACH-EZ Object Mounting Systems for Custom Picture Framing</b>.</p>
            <p>That same day I called the company that made the tools needed to market  <b>ATTACH-EZ</b> , and once I was able  to  convince them that I was not some nut case who had  too much  time  on her hands, they became very interested in my ideas. 
            Picture framing was a whole new industry for their product lines, and together we developed the perfect tools for use in the <b>ATTACH-EZ</b> process and kits.</p>
            <p>As time has gone on I have developed more time saving products such as <b>EZ-Tach</b>, a mounting system  to help mount all types of 3D art . 
            My three educational DVD&rsquo;s,  which include four and a half hours of demonstrations also make it a breeze for anyone new to the framing industry to quickly learn to use any of my methods.  
            <b>Attach-EZ</b> takes much of the labor out and puts the profit back in to shadowbox art projects. The time savings alone is incredible!  
            For new framers as well as established shops there is no doubt that it has become one of the &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; in modern framing equipment today.
